1. What is Git and how is it different than Github?

Git is a local version control system that allows you to track your code and all the changes made to it. Github is a cloud based tool that allows you to share and track your code remotely. It's also very useful when collaborating with others. 

2. Why use the terminal?

Using the command line is the industry standard. It's faster once you get used to it. Plus it's more flexible and explicit than using graphic user interface. 

3. Explain 3 benefits of version control in your own words.

Three different benefits of using version control are:
- It keeps a history of your work, allowing you to easily correct mistakes or switch back to an older version of your code. 

- It makes collaborating and handling conflicts easier.

- It allows you to easily make copies of your code to work on via branching.
